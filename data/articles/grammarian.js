Here are some basic tips when you are theGrammarian.", "Clear. Concise Language: Thespeaker should use as few words as necessary, including short sentences andconversational language. Less is better than more. Note when the speaker hasstrayed away from his/her message. Especially mention when there are too manydetails (as, \"I said. . . Then he said . . . So I said . . .\").", "Incomplete Sentences: Allsentences have a subject, verb and object. A common mistake in speaking isstarting one sentence, then interrupting that sentence to begin another withoutcompleting the first.", "Subject-verb agreement. Ifyour subject is singular, your verb should be plural (\"He wants anagreement\"). If your subject is plural, the verb is singular (\"Theywant an agreement\"). Other examples of bad grammar are, \"They wastaking the bus\", and \"I seen the bird.\"", "Dropped endings: Droppingthe last letter of a word, or incorrectly contracting several words into onecreate a harsh tone. Common examples are: \"gotta\" and\"gonna\".", "Jargon, Slang, Clichés: Somespeakers use the latest buzz words, abbreviations, technical terms or overusedclichés to appear to be more knowledgeable. These terms can confuse or evenirritate the audience.", "Wrong Pronouns: Apronoun is a word that substitutes for a noun. The most common errors involvethe use of \"I\" vs. \"me.\" The pronoun \"I\" is thesubject in a sentence (\"I want the project\"). Me is the object(\"Send the project to her and me\").", "NEVER begin with, \"Me and . . .\" (as, \"Meand Mike went to the store\" It should be \"Mike and I went to thestore.\"). When more than one person is mentioned, you go last (Mike andI). If not sure when to use \"me\" or \"I\", ask yourself whichwould you use if the other subject (Mike) was not mentioned.", "Listen for mixed singular and plural pronouns referringto the same one individual (as, \"The driver was in the left lane. Theywere going the speed limit.\"). Instead of \"they,\" the speakercan use either a universal \"he\" or \"she\" if the gender isnot known. \"They\" is incorrect. The audience may think there weremore drivers.", "Mispronounced Words and Words Not Used Correctly: Mispronounced words and words that are not used in thecorrect way make the audience think about what should be the correctpronunciation (or word), instead of the point the speaker is making.", "Inconsistent Verb Tense (Past - Present - Future): When telling a story, the speaker must be consistentwith action verbs (as, \"I went to the store. Mark says he willdrive\", should be, \"Mark said he will drive.\")", "\"A\" vs. \"AN.\" Correct usage depends on the type of words that followthe \"a\" or \"an.\" Use \"A\" when it precedes a nounthat starts with a consonant or a consonant sound, as, \"He wants aseat.\", or, \"That was a unicycle.\" Use \"AN\" before anoun starting with a vowel or a noun with a silent \"h\", \"Shewants an elephant,\" or \"I want $100 an hour.\"", "Highlight Exceptional Use Of Grammar And Words: It is helpful to the speaker and to the audience whenpositive examples are recognized.", "             Visual, descriptive expressions: as, \"the diminutive customer stared aggressivelyat the distressed salesperson.\"", "             Strong metaphors: comparisons that provide meaning, as: \"the clocklooked at me like the devil in disguise.\"", "             Overall, clear and conciseexplanations: when the point or message isillustrated without a lot of extraneous words.", " ", "Other: if you hear other phrases,words or expressions that make a positive or negative impression, that catchyour attention or distract from your listening.", "The Grammarian From Heaven", "You do not have to report every mistake that each speakercommits.

The trick is to drop out the other personand see if it still makes sense. So, how does this sound: ‘me went to theshops’, or ‘the award was given to I’? You get the idea. For more tips on whatto look for, and how to use I/me correctly, see these short explanations fromthe author of Common Errors in English and from Oxford Dictionaries or watch this short video (2:10 mins) from What You Ought toKnow.", "Who / whom – according to Grammar Monster, whom alwaysfollows a preposition (e.g., with whom); who is always the subject (the persondoing the action) and whom is never the subject. One trick to getting it rightis, as suggested by both Grammar Monster and Grammar Book, to use the‘he/him method’ where he=who and him=whom. So, e.g., who/whom wrote the letter?He wrote the letter; therefore it would be who wrote the letter. And, forwho/whom should I vote? I should vote for him; therefore it would befor whom should I vote. Also see Grammar Girl for more guidance onsorting out who from whom.", "Lie or lay - ‘lie’ means to recline while ‘lay’ means to putor place something, explains GrammarErrors.com.  A tip from eLearn EnglishLanguage: when talking in the present tense, you lie down/on/in, butyou lay something. For more guidance on working out which word touse, see Grammar Girl.", "Subject / verb agreement - this one seems prettystraightforward. Essentially, as Grammar Book explains, the basic rule is thata singular subject takes a singular verb, while a plural subject takes a pluralverb. It gets trickier when you use collective nouns (e.g. team, flock) orwords like ‘each’ and ‘none’, where subjects or joined by ‘and’ or ‘or, orwhere a singular subject is joined by a plural one. A concise explanation ofhow to deal with each of these situations is provided by the University of Wisconsin’sThe Writers’ Handbook.", "Remember, though, as the University of Chicago says, is that ‘grammar is not math’ and ‘rules … are not written in stone’. Grammar rules can be outdated or overly prescriptive, neither reflecting the way people really speak now nor taking into account how language usagemight be tailored to a particular audience. The key thing to remember is whether the language used allowed the speaker to communicate effectively with his or her audience.", " ", "Bear in mind that there are some grammar usages that aren’t reallyrules, despite some people being convinced that they are.

As Oxford Dictionaries explain, it’s where you put an adverbbetween to and a verb – e.g., ‘she used to secretly admire him’, and‘you have to really watch him’.   As Star Trek fans know, it’sperfectly okay to say ‘to boldly go where no man has gone before’.", "Myth 2: You can’t end a sentence with a preposition (or,from, with, of) – it’s okay to say things like ‘What are you waiting for?’ or‘What was she up to?’", "Myth 3: Don’t start a sentence with a conjunction (and, but,or) – it’s fine, as we’ve said through the ages, to finish our stories with:‘And they lived happily ever after’.", "Myth 4: There’s nosuch thing as a singular ‘they’ - according to linguist HenryChurchyard, the singular they has been used since the 14th century by the likesof Jane Austen, William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer. A more recent exampleis provided by U.S. President Obama when he said, ‘the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arrestingsomebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home’.
